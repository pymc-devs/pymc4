        #   - observed
        #       the observed variable(s) for the given model. There are some restrictions on how do we provide
        #       observed variables.
        #       - Every observed variable should have a name either explicitly or implicitly.
        #           The explicit way to provide an observed variable is to use `observed` keyword in a Distribution API
        #           such as `Dist(..., observed=value)`. Observed variables are treated carefully in evaluation
        #           what will be covered a bit later. The other way, a bit less explicit, is to provide a name
        #           for the observed variable is creating a dictionary Dict[str, Any] that maps node names to
        #           the observed values and provide it to the evaluator.
        #       - Every distribution has to have only one value or none of them: either observed or (un)transformed one.
        #           This constraint removes undefined choice and the need to guess for the intent.
        #       Consequently, the above conventions create interesting situations that may appear in API usage.
        #       As mentioned above, a distribution has to have only one value provided or none. Therefore we have to
        #       perform a check at some point to make sure no ambiguous situations happen. The accepted cases should
        #       then contain:
        #       1. observed value is provided in `Dist(..., observed=value)`. This is the regular usage of PyMC4
        #       2. observed value provided in `Dist(..., observed=value)` is suppressed. The case we perform
        #           posterior/prior predictive checks. If the value is not suppressed, the executor will
        #           yield the old value without sampling.
        #       3. observed value provided in `Dist(..., observed=value)` is replaced with new data. The common case
        #           of model being reused to fit for different datasets
        #       4. unobserved value is provided in executor directly to replace an observed value.
        #           An advanced usage of PyMC4 where we change the set of observed nodes (not variables)
        #
        #       The above 4 cases should work with MCMC sampling engine and provide the correct log probability
        #       computation from PyMC4 side. We should now recall that all the computation of log probability
        #       is done in the transformed space, where parameters lie in Rn without any constraints.
        #
        #       The tempting question is "what happens with the observed variables?". Without careful treatment
        #       we would compute log probability for the transformed space if `Dist` in `Dist(..., observed=value)`
        #       is bounded. But this is not required and redundant, the observed variable does not violate the bounds
        #       and is not adjusted in MCMC. Therefore we should take care and not autotransfrom them in the transformed
        #       Executor.
        #
        #       Some other issues may happen if we omit checks proceeding cases 1-4
        #       Case 1. Nothing special here. We just make sure not to see the same value again in unobserved that is
        #           probably a mistake.
        #       Case 2. How do we know we need to forward sample a particular observed node? The solution is to provide a
        #           convention that passing `observed={"observed/variable/name": None}` suppresses an observed set as
        #           `Dist(..., observed=value)` and instructs to sample from this distribution.
        #       Case 3. That's probably explicit to pass `observed={"observed/variable/name": new_value}` to executor
        #           and ask to replace the old observed
        #       Case 4. Suppose we provide an observed value for a specific variable using `Dist(..., observed=value)`.
        #           What should happen if we accidentally pass (un)transformed value to the executor with the same name?
        #           Do we want to replace the observed value with a new one but not observed or it is a typo/mistake?
        #           It may be very hard to track the intent except having a convention that we want to override the
        #           value in here and perform inference on it. My (@ferrine'e) guess is that convention is very unsafe
        #           and implicit, therefore I propose to additionally provide an intent suppressing the observed
        #           variable by name. Actual code should contain `observed={"old/observed/variable/name": None}` passed
        #           along with `values={"old/observed/variable/name": new_inference_value}` to the executor. We can be
        #           sure there is no mistake and safely replace "old/observed/variable/name" with an unobserved one.
        #
        #       You may now see, that logic becomes quite complicated once we care about the details and common
        #       use cases. So far we figured out what checks are to be performed, the next question is at what time they
        #       are performed. In most cases we only get enough information at the time we actually see the node, not
        #       before the execution, therefore there is not choice but to put all the execution validation at runtime.
        #       These checks differ a bit for the transformed and untransformed variables as for the debug purposes
        #       (we want to get the initial sampling state but bored in manually applying the transform) a provided
        #       value for bounded distribution may be either in transformed or untransformed space. So far validation
