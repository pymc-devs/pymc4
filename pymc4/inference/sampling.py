        WARNING: This is an advanced user feature. If you are not sure how to use this, please use
        the default ``True`` value.
        If ``True``, the model's total ``log_prob`` will be automatically vectorized to work across
        multiple indepedent chains using ``tf.vectorized_map``. If ``False``, the model is assumed
        be defined in vectorized way. This means that every distribution has the proper
        ``batch_shape`` and ``event_shape``s so that all the outputs from each distribution's
        ``log_prob`` will broadcast with each other, and that the forward passes through the model
        (prior and posterior predictive sampling) all work on values with any value of
        ``batch_shape``. Achieving this is a hard task, but it enables the model to be safely
        evaluated in parallel across all chains in MCMC, so sampling will be faster than in the
        automatically batched scenario.
    trace_discrete : Optional[List[str]]
        INFO: This is an advanced user feature.
        The pyhton list of variables that should be casted to tf.int32 after sampling is completed

        A seed for reproducible sampling
    Returns

    Trace : InferenceDataType
        An ArviZ's InferenceData object with the groups: posterior, sample_stats and observed_data
    Examples
    --------
    Let's start with a simple model. We'll need some imports to experiment with it.
    >>> import pymc4 as pm
    >>> import numpy as np
    This particular model has a latent variable `sd`
    >>> @pm.model
    ... def nested_model(cond):
    ...     sd = yield pm.HalfNormal("sd", 1.)
    ...     norm = yield pm.Normal("n", cond, sd, observed=np.random.randn(10))
    ...     return norm
    Now, we may want to perform sampling from this model. We already observed some variables and we
    now need to fix the condition.
    >>> conditioned = nested_model(cond=2.)
    Passing ``cond=2.`` we condition our model for future evaluation. Now we go to sampling.
    Nothing special is required but passing the model to ``pm.sample``, the rest configuration is
    held by PyMC4.
    >>> trace = sample(conditioned)
    Notes
    -----
    Things that are considered to be under discussion are overriding observed variables. The API
    for that may look like
    >>> new_observed = {"nested_model/n": np.random.randn(10) + 1}
    >>> trace = sample(conditioned, observed=new_observed)
    This will give a trace with new observed variables. This way is considered to be explicit.
