    General purpose variable scoping.

    PyMC4 scopes intended to store useful information during forward pass of the model.
    This is intended to have more functionality rather than just name scoping.
    So this class should be a starting point for further development.

    The class absorbs any keyword arguments passed there. Accessing any attribute should return
    either None or the passed value by keyword. :func:`Scope.chain` will return all
    attributes for context, starting from the first one (the deepest one is the last one).

        given attribute. It goes through the context stack from the first defined open context
        (the outer most scope) to the last ``Scope`` that was entered (inner most scope).

        Parameters
        ----------
        cls : Scope
            The ``Scope`` subclass.
        attr : str
            The name of the ``Scope`` attribute to get.
        predicate : Callable[[Any], bool]
            A function used to filter scope instances encountered in the context stack. Its signature
            must take a single input argument and return ``True`` or ``False``. If it returns
            ``True``, the ``Scope`` will be processed further. This means that the ``attr``
            attribute's value will be read from the ``Scope`` instance, and said value will be yielded
            (depending on ``drop_none``). If ``False``, the encountered scope will be skiped.
            By default, all encountered ``Scope`` instances are accepted for further processing.
        drop_none : bool
            If ``True`` and the ``attr`` value that is retrieved is ``None``, it is skipped.
            If ``False``, ``None`` will be yielded.
        leaf : Any
            A value to yield after having iterated through the entire context stack. By default,
            no value is yielded.

        Yields
        ------
        Any
            The values of the attribute ``attr`` that are defined in the context stack and
            optionally, the ``leaf`` value.

        Example
        -------
        If we nest several ``Scope`` instances, ``Scope.chain`` can iterate through the
        context stack looking for an attribute's value.

        >>> with Scope(var=1):
        ...     with Scope(var=3):
        ...         print(list(Scope.chain("var")))
        [1, 3]

        If one of the nested ``Scope`` instance doesn't define an attribute's value or defines
        it as ``None``, it is not included in the yielded values by default.

        >>> with Scope(var=1, name="A"):
        ...     with Scope(var=3):
        ...         print(list(Scope.chain("name", drop_none=True)))
        ['A']

        If we provide a ``leaf`` value, it will be returned as long as it isn't ``None`` and
        at the same time pass ``drop_none=True``.

        >>> with Scope(var=1, name="A"):
        ...     with Scope(var=3):
